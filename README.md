# Easy Mask

**Easy Mask** is a Unity tool designed to streamline the process of painting directly on 3D models.

## Features

- **Paint on Any Model**  
  Seamlessly paint directly onto 3D models in the Unity Editor, the only requirement is them having a mesh renderer attached of course.

  Paint on specific texture channels, enabling up to 3 masks in a single texture.

- **Symmetry Painting**  
  The tool provides a built-in symmetry option.

- **Customizable Brushes**  
  Tailor your brush to your needs with options for:  
  - Shape (you can even use your brushes)
  - Size  
  - Smoothness  
  - Opacity  
  - Repetition

- **Output**  
  Choose your desired output texture resolution(up to 4k) and format (PNG and TGA) to suit your project requirements.
